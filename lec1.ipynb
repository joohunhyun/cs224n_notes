    "- In traditional NLP, words are represented as discrete symbols (as one-hot-vectors)\n",
    "- Problem\n",
    "  - If a user searches for “Seattle motel”, we would like to matchdocuments containing “Seattle hotel”.\n",
    "  - However, the two vectors below are orthogonal, so there is no similarity between the two in one-hot-vectors\n",
    "    - Usually, cosine similarity is used to find similarity between words\n",
    "  - Basically, it indexes words to integers (no similarity can be found)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "motel = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0]\n",
    "hotel = [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Solution\n",
    "  - Could try to rely on WordNet’s list of synonyms to get similarity?\n",
